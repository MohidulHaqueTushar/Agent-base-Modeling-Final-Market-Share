# Agent-base-Modeling-Final-Market-Share

In both agent-based models and other sufficiently complicated economic models, there may be path-dependent effects: The trajectory or outcome of individual replications may depend strongly on random effects that occur early in the computation. This creates obstacles for good research with reproducible results. Herw the main interest is in the final market share of the second-most widely used technology (after 5000 time periods as is the default).

**Interpretation:**

The output value of interest ( market share of the second-most widely used technology ) is not reproducible in individual runs because of randomness. In order to get reproducible result, we need to run a series of simulations, collect the target value and analyze them. We can also plot the target value to figure if it has a common pattern or distribution.
